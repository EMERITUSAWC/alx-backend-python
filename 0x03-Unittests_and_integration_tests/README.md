# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project is part of the ALX Backend Python track. It focuses on writing unit and integration tests using Python's `unittest` framework and related tools like `parameterized` and `mock`.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between unit and integration testing
- Write unit tests with assertions and parameterization
- Mock external calls in functions
- Test for exceptions using `assertRaises`
- Use fixtures and decorators to test multiple scenarios
- Test code that uses memoization

## 📁 Files

- `utils.py`: Contains the `access_nested_map` function and more
- `test_utils.py`: Unit tests for functions in `utils.py`

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run the test cases from the root of the project:

```bash
python3 -m unittest 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests/test_utils.py
